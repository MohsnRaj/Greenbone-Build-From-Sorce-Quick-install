# Installation
&ensp;to use My Program first of all you should download it.<br>
after downloading you should give the permision to run the shell script to do that you should run the below cmd:<br>

```
chmod +x $Direction/NAME.sh
```

now you have permision to run the Shell script :clap:. <br>
<i>:pushpin:</i> but befor start to install **ensure that you dont have Conflict package** (for example the Greenbone needs postsql version 14 but you have installed version 16. or you have older version of a package that in installation we install the newest version beside older one) <br>
**i recommended** to you if you have tried to installed the Greenbone and it was unsuccesfully please clean your machine and then jump to next step!<br>
so in this Step we should Creating a User and a Group i put this action on the shell script but unfortunatly some of Client report that it was not working well so i recommended befor run the Bash file run the two cmds below:

sudo useradd -r -M -U -G sudo -s /usr/sbin/nologin gvm 
```
after that you should Added the GVM Group so run the below cmd:
```

$ su $USER

```
in this step you should setting Up sudo For scanning for this requirment you should edit the sudoers.tmp file and to do that you should use visudo like this :
```

```
after running the above operation the sudoers.tmp is open so you shoud add the following role at the middle of the openned file .<br>
<pr>
```
# allow users of the gvm group run openvas
%gvm ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/openvas
```
<pr>
and now you should almost ready to run the Bash file but before that pay some attention at this hints:<br>
&emsp;a. ensure you connection is stable.<br>
&emsp;b. some of link that you should download file from it has slow speed connection so you should pay patiant!<br>
